# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
This module is based on the testing performance of high school students in a certain school district. It looks into a number of different factors that could affect the overall passing rate of each individual school in the district. Some of the factors are the budget per student, size of the school, grade level, and type of school within the district. The re-evaluation of the school district data after it was discovered that the 9th grade class at Thomas High School (THS) had academic dishonesty as well.

## Analysis Results

*How is the district summary affected?*
The district summary did not have much an affect from the removal of the 461 9th graders from THS. Overall passing percentage (>70%) for both reading and math combined went by only 0.3%. It may have only gone down a little due to six schools in the districts being larger.

*How is the school summary affected?*
The overall performance from THS dropped a lot when removing the 9th graders. THS went from a passing rate of about 90.6% to about 65.1%. Reading and math percentage also had dropoffs. (Reading roughly 4% and math roughly 3%). Here is a picture:
